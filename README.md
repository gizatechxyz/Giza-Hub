# Welcome to Orion Tutorials

`gizatechxyz/orion_tutorials` is a repository showcasing examples of using [Orion](https://github.com/gizatechxyz/orion). The aim is to curate brief, high-quality examples with minimal or no dependencies. These examples should be significantly different from each other, providing valuable models that can be incorporated into your existing work.

## Tutorials

- [MNIST Classification with Feedforward Neural Network](./mnist_nn/QAT_MNIST_MLP.ipynb)
- [Verifiable Linear Regression Model](./verifiable_linear_regression_model/notebooks/verifiable_simple_linear_regression_model.ipynb)
- [Verifiable Support Vector Machine](./verifiable_support_vector_machine/notebooks/)

## Learn the basics

Familiarize yourself with Orion concepts and modules. How to build your own neural networks and perform inference.
