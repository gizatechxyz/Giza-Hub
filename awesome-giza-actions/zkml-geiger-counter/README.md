# ZKML Geiger Counter

This is a proof of concept for using Giza Actions on-chain. The project is inspired by [Motema](https://github.com/lancenonce/motema), which was built during ETH Oxford 2024. 

This is just an example, due to the Agent dependencies being from an individual branch in Giza Actions, this code will not work if you are using the latest version of actions on pip. You must check out the [leaf-web3-py](https://github.com/gizatechxyz/actions-sdk/tree/leaf-web3-py) branch for the actions SDK and use that as our actions dependency. 

The project reads radiation values from CSV files generated by a Flipper Zero connected to a Geiger counter. Then, our zkml model (model 430) runs a simple threshold relu function that determines if radiation is high enough for payment. If it is, the model is verified and the transaction is executed on chain. If not, we revert.
